About:
======
This script opens URIs depending on the content-type rather than just the URI
scheme. For instance, will open http links to png files in the default image
viewer.

Also keeps in mind browser startup-time penalty while determining which
browser to spawn to handle text/html links. This order can be controlled by
editing `handler_overrides`.


Requirements:
=============
Needs gobject-introspection-0.10, glib-2.28, procps, and all applications must
have the proper .desktop files and mimetypes associated with them (should be
fine out of the box for most Linux distros).


Usage:
======
Steps to use the script in an integrated fashion with your XDG-compatible DE:

* Symlink 'handler-spawn' into /usr/local/bin/
* Copy the accompanying 'handler-spawn.desktop' to ~/.local/share/applications/
* Run `update-desktop-database -q ~/.local/share/applications`
* Set handler-spawn.desktop as your default handler for:
  - http links (default web browser)
  - Anything else you want (untested!)
